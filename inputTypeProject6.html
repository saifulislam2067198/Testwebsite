In March of 2026, I traveled to the state of Assam in northeast India for the very first time. While I was there, I immersed myself in the beautiful culture and amazing history and found several Assamese Indian dishes that blew my mind. I fell in love with Indian cuisine during my first trip to the country in early 2026. I’ve learned a lot about Indian food since then, but I was blown away by how different assam food are from the usual Indian fare.</p>

<p>Like Southern Indian cuisine, Assamese cuisine is mostly rice-based and incorporates fresh vegetables and  meat. But the dishes in Assam also include things rarely seen in other parts of the country, including river fish, duck, and pigeon</p>

<p>Upon arriving in the city of Guwahati, I learned that Assamese cuisine is a mix of indigenous cooking styles with regional variations. It’s not as rich in  spices as other parts of the country, where up to 500 spices can be used in a single dish.</p>

<p>Despite the relatively low number of spices used, the food is always bursting with memorable and mouthwatering flavors you can’t find anywhere else. Simple preparations are preferred over large, elaborate feasts, and drying and fermentation are used as preservation methods. It all makes for tasty, unpretentious food that will leave your taste buds clamoring for more! These are the 17 Assamese Indian dishes you must eat in Assam.</p>

<p><u>Guwahati</u> is the largest city in Assam and the largest urban area in northeast India. It lies along the southern bank of the Brahmaputra River and is known as “The City of Temples,” but it’s also a foodie paradise with tons of authentic street food and restaurant options. These are my favorite Assamese Indian dishes in Assam!</p>
