            Sticky positioning keeps section headers visible as you scroll through long content panels.
          </p>
          <p>
            This makes it ideal for table headings, navigation tabs, or any element you want to keep in view.

      <!-- Fixed Guidance -->
      <h2>Fixed Positioning: When to Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep headers, footers, or navbars visible at all times.</li>
        <li>Floating action buttons or “back to top” widgets.</li>
        <li>Persistent chat/support icons.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Fixed Positioning: When Not to Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Large layout containers that should scroll with content.</li>
        <li>Elements needing to participate in the normal flow.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Fixed Positioning: Precautions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Manage <code>z-index</code> so fixed elements don’t hide critical UI.</li>
        <li>Ensure fixed items are sized for mobile screens.</li>
        <li>Use sparingly—too many fixed items can clutter the page.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Sticky Guidance -->
      <h2>Sticky Positioning: When to Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep section headers or sub-navigation in view as you scroll.</li>
        <li>Ideal for table headers within a scrollable panel.</li>
        <li>Use for in-page anchors and tab menus.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Sticky Positioning: When Not to Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>For elements that must remain visible outside their container’s scroll area.</li>
        <li>When the container isn’t scrollable or has no height limit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Sticky Positioning: Precautions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Requires a scrollable ancestor with a fixed height or max-height.</li>
        <li>May not work in very old browsers—always test.</li>
        <li>Combine with sensible <code>top</code> offsets to avoid hiding content.</li>
      </ul>
