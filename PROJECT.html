        <h2>Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The tiger is the national animal of India. It is a large carnivorous mammal that roams the forests. The tiger feeds on animals that also live in the forest. The tiger has a coat of orange with black stripes.</p>
        <p>The royal Bengal tiger is found in India. It is a critically endangered species. More than a century ago a large number of tigers lived in the forests. But hunting and poaching of the tiger and its prey, as also destruction of forest habitats have resulted in the reduction of the population of the tiger. The tiger is a protected species.</p>

<p>The Kaziranga National Park in Assam, India, is renowned globally as the most crucial habitat for the Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros, a vulnerable species and a significant symbol of conservation success, boasting the world's largest population of these majestic creatures. These large, herbivorous mammals are easily identified by their distinctive single horn and their unique, armor-plated appearance due to their thick, grey-brown skin with prominent folds, and while they are primarily grazers, their diet also includes leaves, fruits, and aquatic plants. Kaziranga's exceptional conservation efforts, including scientific management, anti-poaching strategies, and reforestation programs, have been instrumental in the rebound of the one-horned rhino population, although poaching remains a persistent threat.</p>

<p>Assam is globally renowned for its tea cultivation, producing over half of India's total tea output from its vast plantations that cover a significant portion of the state's area. Characterized by rich loamy soil, a unique climate, and liberal rainfall, Assam's environment is ideal for growing tea, particularly the robust, malty Assam variety. Commercial tea cultivation in Assam began in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century under British colonial administration, with the discovery of indigenous tea plants and the establishment of early gardens in the 1830s. Today, the industry is not only a major economic contributor but also a significant source of employment for many local communities, from tea leaf pluckers to processing workers.</p>

        <p>Assam, particularly along the Brahmaputra and Barak river basins, is highly susceptible to annual, devastating floods due to a combination of geographical factors, intense monsoon rainfall, and the impacts of climate change, leading to extensive damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and livelihoods, with certain districts consistently experiencing the brunt of the deluge</p>
        <h3>causes and Contributing factors:</h3>
 
        
     <ul>
        <li><h4>geographical Valnerability:</h4></li>
     </ul>
    <p>Assam's location in the Brahmaputra and Barak River basins, combined with its generally low-lying and flat terrain, makes it prone to waterlogging and inundation from overflowing rivers and flash floods originating in neighboring mountainous regions like Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Intense Monsoon Rainfall</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <P>The state experiences heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (June-September), with the Brahmaputra river accumulating significant sediment and debris as it flows into lower elevations, causing its banks to overflow.</P>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rising global temperatures are intensifying monsoon rains and increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events, further exacerbating flood conditions in Assam.</p>

        <h4>Brahmaputra River System</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>The Brahmaputra Valley has an average width of about 80 Km. The main river of the valley, Brahmaputra is one of the largest rivers in the world and rank fifth with respect to its average discharge. The river originates from the Kailash ranges of Himalayas at an elevation of 5300 M. After flowing through Tibet it enters India through Arunachal Pradesh and flows through Assam and Bangladesh before it joins Bay of Bengal.</p>
        <p>The catchments area of Brahmaputra in Tibet is 2, 93,000 Sq. Km; in India and Bhutan is 2,40,000 Sq. Km and in Bangladesh is 47,000 Sq. Km. The Brahmaputra basin extends over an area of 5,80,000 Sq. Km up to its confluence within Bangladesh.</p>
         <p>The average width of Brahmaputra is 5.46 Km. The maximum discharge of Brahmaputra at Pandu near Guwahati was recorded as 72,779 cumec on 23.08.62 and minimum discharge was recorded as 1757 cumec on 22.02.63. The average annual discharge is about 20,000 cumec and average dry season discharge is 4,420 cumec.</p>
          <p>The river slope is very steep till it enters India. A drop of about 4800 M is achieved in a length at about 1700 Km in China (Tibet). This average slope of about 2.82 m/Km gets reduced to about 0.1m/Km in Assam valley. Due to this sudden flattening of river slope, the river becomes braided in nature in the Assam valley. During its course in Assam valley from Kobo to Dhubri the river is joined by about 20 (twenty) important tributaries on its North bank and 13 (thirteen) on its South bank. Joining of these tributaries bringing high sediment load activates braiding.</p>
