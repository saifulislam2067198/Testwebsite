        <table border="1">
Baosi Banikanta Kakati College was established at Nagaon of greater Baosi locality on 25th, July, 1971. This college came into existence as a result of the indefatigable effort of Late Mahendra Mohan Choudhury, a noted freedom fighter, former Chief Minister of Assam and former Governor of Punjab. Baosi was once a seat of diverse cultural and religious activities of Vaishnavite Preacher Mahapurush Srimanta Shankardeva and his disciple Mahapurush Madhabdeva along with Damodardev and Haridev. Then in the late 19<sup>th</sup>" century, Baosi was endowed with a worthy son of Assam, Dr. Banikanta Kakati. Dr. Kakati was a great scholar, linguist, literary critic and academician of great repute. Thus, the name of the college Baosi Banikanta is conflation of 'Baosi' and 'Banikanta Kakati'.</p>
