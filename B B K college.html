            <hr>
            <p>Baosi Banikanta Kakati College was established at Nagaon of greater Baosi locality on 25th, July, 1971. This college came into existence as a result of the indefatigable effort of Late Mahendra Mohan Choudhury, a noted freedom fighter, former Chief Minister of Assam and former Governor of Punjab. Baosi was once a seat of diverse cultural and religious activities of Vaishnavite Preacher Mahapurush Srimanta Shankardeva and his disciple Mahapurush Madhabdeva along with Damodardev and Haridev. Then in the late 19" century, Baosi was endowed with a worthy son of Assam, Dr. Banikanta Kakati. Dr. Kakati was a great scholar, linguist, literary critic and academician of great repute. Thus, the name of the college Baosi Banikanta is conflation of 'Baosi' and 'Banikanta Kakati'.
Baosi Banikanta Kakati College is ideally nestled amidst the lush green paddy fields and sylvan serenity, 12 kilometres away from the din and bustle of the urban atmosphere of Barpeta town. 'Gurukulashram'. As this is essentially a rural college, the academic needs of the local populace is given utmost importance. Since the inception, the college has been able to keep intact the attraction of the youths as a preferred destination of higher education in lower Assam. In this
way the college, having the special focus on relevant present day educational drives along with the emphasis on all round development of the students has successfully completed the 48" year of academic excellence.
Today, the college caters to the educational needs of approximately one thousand and five hundred students in the faculties of Arts, Science and Computer Application in the Higher Secondary and the Undergraduate courses. In spite of having various hardships and limitations, effective and relevant steps have been taken with a view to shape the institution into a centre of quality and excellence. It is such an endeavour for which the college has been rewarded with B++grade (2nd Cycle) by the NAAC peer team. The academic excellence of the college, reaches its zenith when Ms. Gitika Talukdar stood first in the state in H.S. Final Examination (Arts) in 2010 and Ms. Kangkana Talukdar secured 9th position in the same examination in 2012.
To reach out to students belonging to BPL families, SC, ST and Minority communities and remote areas, the college authority has arranged for stipends, thus paying special attention not only to the socio-economic conditions but also to the welfare of the student community, their intellectual and academic development. The two separate RCC Hostels for boys and girls with homely environment and spacious library with modern amenities also play significant role in augmenting the academic excellence. The college understands its accountability and responsibility to the society and therefore, to lay more meaningful role towards excellence, the motto "SEARCH FOR TALENT AND ITS NURTURING" has been adopted. </p>
